I help product and engineering teams turn one high-stakes LLM workflow from demo/pilot into production-grade: reliable, safe, measurable, and defensible.

| Offer | What it does | Typical outcome |
|---|---|---|
| [Audit](#audit) | Define the bar: failure modes, acceptance criteria, eval plan | Clear ship criteria plus a concrete plan |
| [Build and Harden](#build-harden) | Implement evals and harden until the workflow meets the bar | Stable behavior on representative cases |
| [Release Ops](#release-ops) | Gate releases, monitor drift, and keep rollback simple | Predictable releases and fewer regressions |

## Offer 1: Workflow Audit
A focused assessment of one workflow to define the production bar and the path to ship.

**Who it is for**
Teams with a demo or pilot that works on happy paths but is not reliable, testable, or defensible.

**Deliverables**
- Workflow spec: task, failure modes, acceptance criteria
- Evaluation plan: test cases, metrics, regression outline
- Prioritized recommendations: what to do next and why

**Typical timeline**
1 to 2 weeks (depends on access and scope)

**Success criteria**
- Acceptance criteria are explicit and testable
- An evaluation plan exists that can gate changes and prevent regressions
- Next steps are scoped and prioritized

## Offer 2: Build and Harden
Build or baseline the workflow, implement the eval suite and regression harness, then iterate until it meets the production bar for quality, safety, and auditability.

**Who it is for**
Teams that want the workflow shipped into production, not just assessed.

**Deliverables**
- Evaluation suite plus regression harness integrated into your dev and release flow
- Hardened workflow: grounding, validation, routing, adaptation where justified
- Versioning plan for key artifacts: data, model or adapter, prompts, configs
- Release gate checklist and rollout plan

**Typical timeline**
2 to 6+ weeks (depends on workflow complexity and integration)

**Success criteria**
- The workflow passes eval gates reliably on representative cases
- Regressions are caught before release
- Latency and cost stay within agreed thresholds

<a id="release-ops"></a>
## Offer 3: Release Ops
Operate releases like software: versioned artifacts behind eval gates, safe rollouts with rollback, drift monitoring, and periodic re-tuning.

**Who it is for**
Workflows already in production that must stay stable across upstream model, data, or dependency changes.

**Deliverables**
- Eval-gated release process and cadence
- Monitoring plan: quality proxies, safety signals, drift triggers
- Rollback plan for model, data, prompts, and configs
- Retuning triggers and review cadence

**Typical timeline**
Ongoing support (monthly retainer or fixed cadence)

**Success criteria**
- Stable quality over time despite upstream changes
- Drift is detected early and handled predictably
- Rollback is fast and low-risk
