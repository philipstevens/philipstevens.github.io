## 💼 Experience

### Self-employed

***Foundation Model Engineer (Consultant)***

*Mar 2023 - Present*

High-stakes, domain-adapted LLM workflows, made reliable.

*Selected outcomes:*

- Built spec-driven eval suites with regression gates integrated into CI, reducing undetected production regressions to zero across multiple release cycles.
- Stabilized RAG pipelines across embedding model updates with retrieval instrumentation, golden sets, and regression tracking — maintaining 94%+ answer accuracy through 3 consecutive model swaps.
- Shipped versioned LoRA/QLoRA adapters validated against task-specific evals, cutting fine-tuning iteration time from weeks to days.
- Improved tool and agent reliability with explicit tool contracts, routing guardrails, and scenario-based recovery tests — reducing tool call failure rate by over 60%.
- Reduced serving cost by 40–55% via profiling, batching, quantization, and caching strategies validated under eval gates before deployment.

### Agoda

***Senior Data Scientist***

*Mar 2020 - Feb 2023, Bangkok, Thailand*

Leading online travel agency, subsidiary of Booking Holdings.

*Accomplishments and Responsibilities:_

- Spearheaded several frontend personalization projects using contextual bandit algorithms (e.g., linear Thompson Sampling), dynamically adjusting content based on user data, boosting bookings by 500/day.
- Developed recommendation systems with Word2Vec/Doc2Vec embedding models, increasing daily bookings by hundreds.
- Enhanced systems to highlight key reviews using advanced BERT and LDA topic models, significantly boosting user engagement and resulting in additional bookings.
- Collaborated with the product team, offering data-driven strategic recommendations that improved business outcomes and informed key decision-making processes.

### Quantcast

***Data Scientist***

*Oct 2014 - Sep 2018, London, UK*

Industry-leading AI-powered targeted advertising and audience measurement based in San Francisco. Joined as part of startup
acquisition.

*Accomplishments and Responsibilities:_

- Directed many experiments to enhance core targeting models using advanced feature engineering, new data sources, refined model architectures, hyperparameter tuning, and domain drift monitoring, achieving 2-10% quarterly conversion rate improvements.
- Managed the end-to-end machine learning lifecycle and data pipeline for core targeting models, ensuring robust performance and consistency across data collection, processing, model training, deployment, and performance monitoring.
- Collaborated with external stakeholders to deliver custom projects and regularly communicated technology updates to advertising agencies, strengthening client relationships and enhancing project outcomes.

### Struq

***Data Scientist***

*Oct 2013 - Sep 2014, London, UK*

A fast-paced AdTech startup, acquired by Quantcast.

*Accomplishments and Responsibilities:_

- Integrated user data into click, conversion, and revenue prediction models, enhancing accuracy through advanced feature engineering
techniques, resulting in a ~20% increase in user clicks and conversions for clients.

## 🤖 Skills

- **Post-training and adaptation (core):**
  - Instruction tuning (SFT), task and domain adaptation

  - PEFT: LoRA and QLoRA adapters, adapter packaging, versioning, merge and composition strategies

- **Data for post-training (what actually moves the needle):**
  - Dataset design and curation: filtering, dedup, quality gates, label guidelines, synthetic data with verification
  - Decontamination and leakage control: strict train and eval separation, contamination checks
  - Eval set construction: golden sets, stress sets, adversarial sets aligned to real failure modes

- **Evaluation and release engineering:**
  - Spec-driven evals: failure modes, acceptance criteria, scenario tests, regression harnesses
  - CI integrated eval gates, safe rollout patterns, rollback criteria, drift monitoring triggers

- **Grounded workflows and tool reliability:**
