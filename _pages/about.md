Hi, I’m Phil.

I’m a Foundation Model Engineer. I help product and engineering teams turn one critical, high-stakes AI workflow from demo/pilot into **production-grade**: reliable, safe, measurable, and defensible.

This site is my personal portfolio. I share projects, notes, and experiments across ML and LLM systems.

Right now I’m focused on spec-driven evals, post-training, and release gates for domain-adapted LLM workflows.

## Work with me

If you’re stuck between demo and production, it usually shows up as:
- hallucinations or inconsistent edge-case behavior
- regressions after model or data updates
- no defensible evidence trail for safety/compliance questions
- latency and cost that don’t scale

### Production-Grade AI Workflow Audit

A focused assessment of one workflow to define the bar and the path to ship.

You get:
- a workflow spec (task, failure modes, acceptance criteria)
- a starter evaluation plan (test cases, metrics, regression outline)
- a prioritized set of recommendations (what to do next and why)

## What I’m interested in

Computer vision, NLP, reinforcement learning, generative AI/LLMs, and building systems that are efficient, scalable, and trustworthy. I’m especially interested in evaluation, post-training, and release gating for high-stakes workflows.

If you’re building something meaningful and want to collaborate, reach out.
