Hi, I’m Phil.

I’m a Foundation Model Engineer currently focused on making LLM workflows reliable in production.

My focus is on domain adaptation via post-training, and on eval-driven development and release gating for both training and deployment.

I bring 10+ years of applied ML across personalization, recommendations, NLP, and real-time decision systems, including production work at Agoda and Quantcast.

This site is my portfolio. I share case studies, technical write-ups, and tutorials across evaluation-first LLM systems.
