Welcome to my website.  

As you can see there isn't much here yet. This is where I intend to share projects I've been working on, as well things I've learned and personal musings related to the fields of data science, machine learning and artificial intelligence. 

I will divide the content into Projects and Blog posts. Blog posts will be the bulk of the content including mostly tutorials, how-to guides and other useful information. Projects are where I intend to share more complete web applications that make use of the various models I build. 

Hope you will find something of value here.
