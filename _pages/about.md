Hi, I’m Phil.

I’m a Foundation Model Engineer. I work on high-stakes, domain-adapted LLM workflows where reliability matters. 

My focus is spec-driven evals, post-training, and gated releases that keep behavior stable across updates and make shipping defensible.

I bring 10+ years of applied ML across personalization, recommendations, NLP, and real-time decision systems, including production work at Agoda and Quantcast.

This site is my portfolio. I share case studies, technical write-ups, and tutorials across evaluation-first LLM systems.
