Hi, I’m Phil.

I’m a Foundation Model Engineer. I help product and engineering teams turn one critical, high-stakes AI workflow from demo/pilot into production-grade: reliable, safe, measurable, and defensible.

I bring 10+ years of applied ML across personalization, recommendations, NLP, and real-time decision systems, including production work at Agoda and Quantcast.

This site is my portfolio. I share case studies, technical write-ups, and tutorials across evaluation-first LLM systems.

Right now I’m focused on spec-driven evals, post-training, and release gates for domain-adapted LLM workflows.

## Topics I write about
- Evaluation and regression testing for LLM workflows  
- Grounded retrieval (RAG), attribution behavior, retrieval instrumentation  
- Post-training (LoRA/QLoRA, preference tuning) and packaging  
- Release gating, monitoring, rollback, and operating model and data changes
