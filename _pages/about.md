Hi, I’m Phil.

I’m a Foundation Model Engineer. I help product and engineering teams turn one critical, high-stakes AI workflow from demo/pilot into production-grade: reliable, safe, measurable, and defensible.

This site is my portfolio. I share case studies, technical write-ups, and tutorials across evaluation-first LLM systems.

Right now I’m focused on spec-driven evals, post-training, and release gates for domain-adapted LLM workflows.

## Proof, selected outcomes
- Prevented production regressions by building spec-driven eval suites and integrating regression gates into release processes.
- Stabilized retrieval quality across updates by hardening RAG pipelines with retrieval instrumentation and regression tracking.
- Improved domain performance by shipping versioned fine-tuning packages (LoRA/QLoRA) validated against task-specific evals.
- Enabled reliable agent and tool workflows via tool contracts, routing and guardrails, and scenario tests for correctness and recovery.
- Improved serving efficiency without quality loss through profiling, batching, quantization and runtime selection, and caching within eval thresholds.

## How I work
1. Define the bar: map the workflow, enumerate failure modes, set acceptance criteria.
2. Build evidence: implement evals and a regression harness, then iterate until the bar is met consistently.
3. Ship safely: version artifacts behind gates, monitor drift, and keep rollback simple.

## Background
I bring 10+ years of applied ML across personalization, recommendations, NLP, and real-time decision systems, including production work at Agoda and Quantcast.

## Topics I write about
- Evaluation and regression testing for LLM workflows  
- Grounded retrieval (RAG), attribution behavior, retrieval instrumentation  
- Post-training (LoRA/QLoRA, preference tuning) and packaging  
- Release gating, monitoring, rollback, and operating model and data changes
