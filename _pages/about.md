Hi, I’m Phil! Welcome to my digital space.

I’ve spent over 10 years working in AI and machine learning, solving problems across various fields and learning from each challenge. This space is where I plan to share my personal projects, ideas, and thoughts on topics like computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, generative AI, LLMs, and more.

I’m deeply interested in how AI can address global challenges, such as promoting sustainability in energy, agriculture, and conservation, and expanding opportunities for underserved communities. I’m equally interested in advancing AI itself, improving model efficiency and scalability, and building secure, transparent, and trustworthy systems.

I love collaborating on meaningful projects and creating transformative ideas from the ground up. If that sounds like your kind of thing, let’s connect!
