Hi, I’m Phil! Welcome to my digital space.

With over 10 years of experience in AI and machine learning, I’ve had the opportunity to work on innovative solutions across various fields, solving complex problems and learning from every challenge. This space is where I plan to share my personal projects, ideas, and thoughts on topics like computer vision, natural language processing, reinforcement learning, generative AI, LLMs, and more.

I’m passionate about using AI to address global challenges—driving sustainability in areas like energy, agriculture, and conservation, and creating opportunities for underserved communities. I’m equally interested in advancing AI itself, improving model efficiency and scalability, and building secure, transparent, and trustworthy systems.

I love collaborating on meaningful projects and creating transformative ideas from the ground up. If that sounds like your kind of thing, let’s connect!
