Hi, I'm Phil.

I'm a foundation model engineer focused on making LLM workflows reliable in production. I care about this because I've seen too many promising systems fail when they hit real users — and most of those failures were preventable with better evals and release discipline.

I bring 10+ years of applied ML across personalization, recommendations, NLP, and real-time decision systems, including production work at Agoda and Quantcast. I've been consulting since 2023.

I publish case studies and technical write-ups here to share how I approach this work.
