Most AI pilots start strong, then break in ways no one predicted.

## Why teams get stuck

- Outputs vary too much to trust
- Hard to explain or sign off on what it produces
- Changes ship without knowing what they'll break
- Too slow or expensive to scale up

## The fix

1. Define what "good" looks like (and what can't
happen)
2. Test until it passes consistently
3. Add release checks so updates don't quietly break it

## Offer 1: Audit {#audit}

*Get clarity + a plan*

If you have a workflow that kind of works, this is the fast way to get clarity. Pull the system apart, look at real examples, and pin down what "good enough" actually means for your use case.

What you get:

- The main ways it fails (with real examples)
- A clear definition of "good enough" everyone can agree on
- A step-by-step plan to make it reliable

## Offer 2: Build & Fix {#build-and-fix}

*Make it reliable*

This covers implementation. Use an existing plan (or define "good"), build the tests, and iterate until behavior is consistent on real inputs.

Deliverables:

- A repeatable test set you can run before shipping changes
- A version that behaves consistently on real inputs
- A simple rollout + rollback plan

---

## Offer 3: Keep it Stable {#keep-it-stable}

*Keep it reliable as you ship*

For teams already in production (or shipping frequently) who want fewer surprises. Make releases repeatable, catch regressions early, and keep the tests up to date as new edge cases show up.

Ongoing outputs:

- A lightweight release checklist
- Early warning when things start degrading
- New test cases added as edge cases show up

## FAQ

<div class="faq-section" markdown="1">

### Can we do this under NDA?

Yes, an NDA can be signed before reviewing sensitive details.

### What do you need from us?

Usually: a few example inputs/outputs, current prompts or workflow code, and enough context to define what "good" looks like. For Build & Fix, repo access and a way to run tests in CI may also be needed.

### What about sensitive data?

Data exposure can be minimized. Redacted samples, synthetic test cases, and tight access controls all work. Work can happen in your environment if needed.

### What does "success" mean?

Success means the workflow meets a clear definition of "good" and passes tests on representative cases, within agreed limits for cost, speed, and quality.

### Who needs to be involved?

Typically: one engineering owner, one product/domain owner, and someone who can approve the definition of "good" and provide access.

### How long does this usually take?

- Audit: 1-2 weeks
- Build & Fix: typically 3-8 weeks, depending on scope
- Keep it Stable: ongoing

### How does it start?

Book an intro call. If it's a fit, the next step is defining the workflow, scope, and success criteria, then starting with an Audit or jumping straight to Build & Fix.

[Email me](mailto:philipstevens4@gmail.com){: .btn .btn--primary }

Hi, I'm Phil.

I'm a foundation model engineer focused on making LLM workflows reliable in production. I care about this because I've seen too many promising systems fail when they hit real users — and most of those failures were preventable with better evals and release discipline.

I bring 10+ years of applied ML across personalization, recommendations, NLP, and real-time decision systems, including production work at Agoda and Quantcast. I've been consulting since 2023.

I publish case studies and technical write-ups here to share how I approach this work.

<h2>How to Use This Checklist</h2>
<p>This checklist is designed for engineering teams preparing to ship an LLM-powered workflow to production. Work through each section before release. Items marked with <span class="critical">[CRITICAL]</span> are non-negotiable; shipping without them significantly increases the risk of production incidents.</p>

<hr>

<h2>Score Your Readiness</h2>
<p>After completing the checklist, tally your results here:</p>

    <th style="width: 25%;">Passed</th>
    <th style="width: 25%;">Total</th>

<h2>Part 6: Quick Reference</h2>

<h3>Red Flags That Should Block Release</h3>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Regression on any previously-passing test case</strong> — Something broke</li>
  <li><strong>Safety eval failure</strong> — Non-negotiable</li>
  <li><strong>Latency p95 above threshold</strong> — Will affect users</li>
  <li><strong>Untested rollback</strong> — You will need it eventually</li>
  <li><strong>"We'll fix it after launch"</strong> — You probably won't</li>
</ol>

<h3>Common Mistakes</h3>

    <th>Mistake</th>
    <th>Why It Hurts</th>
    <th>What to Do Instead</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>

    <td>Any variance causes false failures</td>
    <td>Set threshold below current with small buffer</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eval suite in notebook, not CI</td>
    <td>Gets skipped under deadline pressure</td>
    <td>Integrate into PR workflow from start</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>No rollback testing</td>
    <td>Rollback fails when you need it most</td>
    <td>Test rollback monthly, after every infra change</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Ignoring cost until bill arrives</td>
    <td>Budget surprises, rushed optimization</td>
    <td>Track cost per request from day one</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>"Model X is better" without eval</td>
    <td>Vibes don't catch regressions</td>
    <td>Always run full eval before switching</td>
