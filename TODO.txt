============
AI Prompt
============

Evaluate how well this website aligns with the lean canvas and how effective it is, both in terms of content/messaging and layout/style/aesthetics. Note the transitionary customer segments, don't make overly specific and keep jargon light, otherwise it risks alienating early cusomers that I need.
Also note the index.md front matter (title, excerpt) cannot be any longer than what it currently is.
Aside from the about page do not reference to me as an individual (no "I").
Break this down to a list of instructions I can pass my coding agent. Provide the exact content and layout/style/aesthetic level changes to be made and describe where and how they fit, but leave the actual nitty gritty for coding to the agent.
