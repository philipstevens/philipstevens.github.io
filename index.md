## What I do

I make one high-stakes LLM workflow production-grade: spec → evals → hardening → gated releases.

## If you are stuck between demo and production, it usually looks like
- Hallucinations or inconsistent behavior on edge cases
- Regressions after model or data updates
- No defensible evidence trail for safety and compliance questions
- Latency and cost that do not scale

## What I deliver per workflow
- Workflow spec: task, failure modes, acceptance criteria
- Evaluation suite: test sets, metrics, regression harness
- Hardened workflow: grounded, validated, tuned
- Eval-gated releases: versioning, drift monitoring, rollback

## Typical workflow types
- Grounded search and Q&A (RAG)
- Summarization and synthesis
- Extraction to structuring
- Classification, triage, routing
- Assisted drafting and editing
