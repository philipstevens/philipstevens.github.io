## What I do

I make your LLM workflows production-grade and domain-adapted: spec → evals → hardening → gated releases.

Especially helpful when you’re moving from demo to production and need customization plus measurable reliability.

## The usual reasons AI pilots get stuck

- Outputs aren’t reliable and updates break behavior
- You can’t explain or defend outputs for review, safety, or compliance
- It’s too slow or too expensive to run at scale

## How I solve it

- Define the spec and acceptance criteria
- Build evals, then harden the workflow until it passes consistently
- Ship behind release gates with monitoring and rollback

## Typical workflows I help with

- Answer questions and draft responses from your documents
- Summarize and combine information
- Extract key fields and route or classify items

## Who I am

- 10+ years applied ML across personalization, NLP, and real-time systems
- Production experience at Agoda and Quantcast
- Consultant since 2023 focused on evals, post-training, and release gating
