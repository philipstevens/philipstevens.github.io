## What I do

I make your LLM workflows production-grade and domain-adapted: spec → evals → hardening → gated releases.

Especially helpful when you’re moving from demo to production and need customization plus measurable reliability.

## The usual reasons AI pilots get stuck
- Outputs aren’t reliable and updates break behaviour
- Outputs aren’t defensible for review, safety, or compliance
- It’s too slow or too expensive to run at scale

## How I solve it
- Define the spec and acceptance criteria
- Build evals, then harden the workflow until it passes consistently
- Ship behind release gates with monitoring and rollback

## Typical workflows I help with
- Answer questions and draft responses from your documents
- Summarize and combine information from documents
- Extract key fields and route or classify items
